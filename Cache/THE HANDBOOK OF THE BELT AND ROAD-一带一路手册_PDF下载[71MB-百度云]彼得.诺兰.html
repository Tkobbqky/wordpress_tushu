Judging from the historical experience， the international system has been continuously developed and improved in the process of alternation of old and new forces， especially the interaction of major countries. Regarding the current international system， China upholds its reform stand. On the one hand， China has been integrating itself into the intemational community through reform and opening-up and has become a beneficiary of the current international system. Xi Jinping pointed out that “As far as the existing international system is concerned， China has been a participant， builder and contributor. We stand firmly for the international order and system that is based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter”. On the other hand， there are also many injustices and unreasonable phenomena need to be adjusted in the current international system. In this regard， Xi Jinping stressed that “A great number of countries， especially developing countries， want to see a more just and equitable international system， but it doesn't mean they want to unravel the entire system or start all over again. Rather， what they want is to reform and improve the system to keep up with the times”. In order to promote the development and improvement of the international system， China has successively proposed a series ofimportant reform concepts， including the new security concept featuring “mutual trust， mutual benefit， equality and cooperation”， the initiative of promoting democracy in intemational relations based on the multi-polar development trend， the solemn commitment to adherence to a peaceful development path， and the advocacy of “fostering a new form of major-country relations featuring no confiict or confrontation， mutual respect and win-win cooperation”. In 2017， the report to the 19th CPC National Congress further proposed to “foster a new form ofinternational relations” based on the following core principles. First，mutual respect. Countries of different size， strength or wealth， and with diverse systems，religions and civilizations， are all equals. Second， fairness and justice. The law of the jungle which puts the weak at the mercy of the strong must be rejected， and the legitimate rights and interests of all countries， in particular the developing countries， should be upheld.Third，win-win cooperation. The outdated mindset of zero-sum game or winner taking all should bereplaced with a new approach ofworking for common development and shared benefits.　　Second， enhancing the common interests of all mankind is an important goal of China as a responsible major country. As a world we are now facing growing uncertainties and destabilizing factors. Global economic growth lacks energy； the gap between rich and poor continues to widen； hotspot issues arise often in some regions； and unconventional security threats like terrorism， cyber-insecurity， major infectious diseases， and climate change continue to spread. As human beings we have many common challenges to face.We are in urgent need of feasible solutions to solve various global problems. In response，China has proposed the initiative of “building a community of a shared future for mankind”so as to build an open， inclusive， clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace，universal security， and common prosperity. Its contents include： we should take a new approach to developing state-to-state relations with communication， not confrontation，and with partnership， not alliance； we should commit to settling disputes through dialogue and resolving differences through discussion， coordinate responses to traditional and non-traditional threats， and oppose terrorism in all its forms； we should make economic globalization more open， inclusive， and balanced so that its benefits are shared by all； we should work together to facilitate exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations， we should be good friends to the environment and cooperate to tackle climate change.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　The countries of the world are at different stages of development and have their own differenthistories and cultures， but the people of all countries share a common desire for peace and development. It is also the goal and constant commitment of the ruler of every country toraise the country's economic and social development level with a view to bringing peopleout of poverty and improving people's quality oflife. Meanwhile， people tend to agree thata country should also accommodate the legitimate concems of others when seeking its owndevelopment and the common development of all countries is the only way for a country toachieve its sustainable development. Since Comrade Xi Jinping was elected the president ofChina in 2013， he has consistently advocated and made profound interpretations of the ideaof building a community of shared future for mankind， which has quickly gained widespreadrecognition from the international community. The idea itself has also been recorded in aseries of UN resolutions.　　A desire for common development does not mean the pursuit of a single path， nor doesit entails a single model. Instead， it allows diversified and localised development pathsthat keep abreast with the times. However， all countries also face common obstacles intheir development， such as a bottleneck of capital accumulation， inequality in intemationaleconomic and trade relations， low infrastructure capacity， difficulties in cultivating humancapital， and low mobilization capability and inefficient allocation of human resources.Therefore， while acknowledging and encouraging diversified models， all countries aroundthe world， especially the developing countries， are also desperate for a strategic frameworkfor development that not only helps to create the necessary conditions for development，breaking the bottlenecks in key areas and learning from success or failure， but also gives each country an adequate space of choice. The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 is such an open fiamework.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　蔡昉（CAI Fang），Editor in Chief， is the Vice President of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.He is a member of the Standing Committee and Vice Chairman of the Agricultural &amp; Rural Affairs Committee of the 13th National People's Congress of China.
