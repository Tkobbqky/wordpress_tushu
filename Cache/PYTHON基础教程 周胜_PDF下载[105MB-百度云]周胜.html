本教材以 Windows操作系统为平台，系统讲解 Python3的基础知识。全书共 11章，主要介绍了 Python基本语法、字符串、列表、元组、字典、文件的读写、函数与模块等基础知识。首先介绍了 Python的特点、发展及推荐学习方法，然后讲授了 Python基础语法、流程控制语句、数据类型、函数、模块、面向对象、文件处理、异常处理、数据库操作，*后增加了全国计算机等级考试二级 Python语言程序设计考试中所要求的第三方库相关知识等。教材根据“自主式一体化教学”模式，对教材的构成要素进行调整，按照 Python的有关知识由浅入深、从易到难进行编写，并在每章后布置实训与练习，实现“教、学、做”一体，从而切实提高学生的持续发展能力。本教材力求为数据采集及分析提供全面的语言基础，同时也考虑到部分学有余力的同学参加全国计算机等级考试的要求，补充了全国计算机等级考试二级 Python语言程序设计考试大纲规定的知识，故也适合作为全国计算机等级考试二级考试 Python语言程序设计考试参考用书。为提升学习效果，教材结合实际应用提供了大量的案例进行说明和训练，并配以完善的学习资料和支持服务，包括教学大纲、教学进度表、教学 PPT、案例源码等，为读者提供全方位的学习服务。
