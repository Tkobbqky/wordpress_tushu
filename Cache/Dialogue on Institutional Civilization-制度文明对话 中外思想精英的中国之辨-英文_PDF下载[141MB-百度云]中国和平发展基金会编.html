　　中国和平发展基金会编写的《制度文明对话(中外思想精英的中国之辩)(英文版)》： there is no such a
thing as "standard system" in the world. to determine if a
country's system is superior or "civilized", we should see if it
suits the country's actual situation, history and culture, if it is
in line with the trends of the world and the times, and if it can
promote the country's development and prosperity, rather than
require it to meet a certain standard or rule.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
