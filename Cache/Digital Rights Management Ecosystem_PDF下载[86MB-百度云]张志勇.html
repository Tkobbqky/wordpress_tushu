　　《security trust and risk in digital rights management
ecosystem》主要内容：the monograph has an objective to make an
interesting insight on security, trust and risk in drm ecosystem
from interdisciplinary perspective. there are involved with a
tradeoff between drm security and utility,in order to implement an
optimal security-utility equilibrium and establish a
multi-participant trust for various participants in the contents
value chain, by cost-effectively adopting and deploying of security
policies and mechanisms. and also, inspired by risk management,we
made in-depth investigation on security risk management in contents
value chain. finally,we gave a drm application case for digital
home network and a prototype on copyrighted multimedia
contents.
