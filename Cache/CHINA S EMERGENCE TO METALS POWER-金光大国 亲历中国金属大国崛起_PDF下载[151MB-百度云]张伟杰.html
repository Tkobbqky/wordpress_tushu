trade with china for sino-west longterm friendly win-win
cooperation is absolutely not my autobiography, nor a monograph on
sino-west metals trade only as my personal account with actual
examples for welcoming the experts to analyse why the west and
china misunderstand each other, and how both sides can improve
harmony. only by combining soft and hard, yin and yang, can we
build on our strengths and overcome our weaknesses in order to
overcome the global recession and achieve steady development for
win-win cooperation.

hardship and disasters, the china of the 1970s was, to quote
chairman mao, “poor and blank”. the nation’s per-capita output of
metals was among the lowest in the world. there were the shenyang
copper and fushun aluminium smelters left behind by the soviet
union and japan respectively, and not much else besides. but
finally the oriental“sleeping dragon” woke up and took flight.
after deng xiaoping introduced the policies of “reform and
opening-up” at the end of the 1970s, china experienced continuous
rapid economic growth. her production and consumption of metals
overtook those of europe and america, to occupy the number one spot
in the new millennium.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Jonathan Chang<br/>
