　　力文先生在一个勤劳的家庭中长大。他的父母经营着自己的生意，也在外打工。自幼时起，直到上大学，他都一直跟着父母一起工作。因此，他深知工作对于实现正义、公众、友谊等真正有价值的东西的重要性。
　　他对中国的第一个记忆是父母告诉他不要浪费粮食，因为中国的许多儿童还在挨饿。他第二个记忆来自20世纪70年代，那时中国开放了，随后新闻媒体对中国兴趣大增。一次媒体采访了一位中国妇女，当被问到她丈夫哪一点最好时，她回答说是他的政治思想好。那时，这个说法听起来很奇怪。
　　2005年，力文博士来中国当英语老师。目前，他在中央民族大学教书，业余时间写歌、唱歌。
　　如今他已到过20个省份，大小城市、城镇和乡村都去过。作为一名讲师、歌手、旅行家以及演讲和辩论教练，他与近200所大学的学生、教职工、领导，以及各个年龄段的人、每个民族的人有过接触。
　　Mark Levine was born in Los Angeles to a post-Holocaust American Jewish family. After getting a Ph.D. in sociology, he volunteered full time at organizations for low-income workers. Dr. Levine did this in many communities across the United States for nearly 30 years.
　　His first memory related to China is his parents telling him not to waste food because many children in China were starving. His second memory is from the 1970s, when China opened and he saw an interview with a Chinese woman. Asked what she considered her husband’s best feature, she said it was his political ideology. At the time it seemed a strange thing for her to say. 
　　Dr. Levine came to China as an English teacher in 2005. He has visited 20 provinces and been to villages, towns and cities large and small. As a lecturer, singer and tourist as well as a speaking and debating coach, he has met students, faculty and administrators from close to 200 universities. He has also met people of all ages and from most of China’s 56 ethnic groups.
