This book consists of prose and photos. The authors are a couple
born in the 1990s. While volunteer teaching in Kangba, Tibet, they wrote a
great deal of prose and poetry, and took many photos. The snapshots, closely
related to the prose, capture their reality. Their language is succinct,
affectionate, and powerful.
This book is informative, thoroughly describing the lives of Kangba
children from various angles, including: The child who was deserted by her
parents received love from the teachers; the students wore shabby clothes, but
were simple and honest, helping their teachers sweep the floor, and wash
clothes and dishes; when they were seriously hurt while playing, which terribly
frightened the teachers, they just cried for a while and then felt all right,
very brave indeed; they were not so much aware of pain and grief, but were
always optimistic and happy; under harsh conditions, they didn’t complain, but
lived sturdily and bravely!
The authors depict the unique life of Tibetans and communicate their
own feelings and thoughts, distinct from those of their peers, which they
experienced while volunteer teaching in the Tibetan region. Open the book and
you will be thrilled by this magical place.

       Innocentand naive, Lijun cycled over 1,500 kilometers to Beijing with a group ofuniversity students. On the way, she met Xiaolong, her husband now. Laterthey traveled to Tibet to volunteer teach, helping children there collectbooks and clothes. They even encouraged other teachers to volunteer teachwith them to pass this love from one group to another. They have foundfulfillment in their lives and their stories are worthy of reading and appreciation.

这本书让我感觉非常亲切，仿佛自己重回在西藏支教的那一年。西藏的山、西藏的水、西藏的人、西藏的事、西藏的情……都是这本书里让我们产生共鸣的地方。这本书用平实质朴的文字和平凡鲜活的图片，向我们展示了青藏高原的风貌和生活，也道出了“康巴少年的梦”。我想，只有曾经去西藏支教服务过的人，才能真正体会这种感觉——那里的发展需要人才，而对孩子的教育就是对未来发展*的负责。所以，我十分敬佩作者能在高原进行长时间的支教行动！我会把这本书推荐给更多的师弟师妹，也希望有更多的青年人一起努力，为西部发展奉献力量。*后，唯愿每个西藏孩子，都能够开心快乐地成长，实现梦想。

I found that this book is very close tome as it brings me back to the year I volunteer taught in Tibet, wheremountains, water, people, stories, and affection all resonate with ourfeelings. Using simple language and vivid pictures, this book presents thefeatures and life of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and “The Dreams of Youth inKangba”. Only those who served as volunteer teachers can have a fullunderstanding of this. Talents are desperately needed for development of thearea, and education for children is the priority for development. I thinkhighly of the authors who volunteer teach on the Plateau over long periods oftime! I will recommend this book to more schoolmates in hope that more youthwill join us in contributing to development of China’s western region. I wisheach Tibetan child will grow happily and realize their dreams.
