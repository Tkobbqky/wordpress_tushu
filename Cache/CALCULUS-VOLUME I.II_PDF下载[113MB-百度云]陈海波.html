The requirementsof such students have influenced its content and presentation helped in many waysby the authors' long and continuous experience of teaching mathematical methods tovarious degree students in Central South University. It is divided into two volumes.The first volume contains Calculus of single variable and infinite series. The sec-ond volume consists of Calculus of multivariable with analysis geometrics and ordi-nary differential equations.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
