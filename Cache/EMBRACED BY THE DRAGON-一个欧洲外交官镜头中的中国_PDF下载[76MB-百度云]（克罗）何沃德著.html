this photo book i try to present my view on china，sometimes from a
different angle then most of the people with photo camera in their
hands will do. living in beijing for six years changed my
perspective on how i see things around me.i can say that i’m not
tourist anymore.so this is the reason that some of my photos are
not just remembrances on an interesting thing i just saw.but，at the
same time on the other photos you can see that i’m just a guy with
camera impressed with things that i just saw in front of me.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
