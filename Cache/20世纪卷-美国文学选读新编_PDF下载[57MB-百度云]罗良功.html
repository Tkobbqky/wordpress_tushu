  The leading spokesman of 19th century literary realism was William DeanHowells who had argued for the treatment of the "smiling aspects of life" as beingthe more "American. " But by the end of the 19th century, a generation of writersarose "whose ideas of the workings of the universe and whose perception ofsociety's disorders led them to a new and harsher realism, a naturalism thatattempted to achieve extreme objectivity and frankness.  America's literarynaturalists portrayed characters of low social and economic orders who were shapedby their environment and heredity and moved by animal passions"（i）. Their writingsdealt with cities like Chicago and San Francisco as well as Boston, with workingclass characters as well as middle-class intellectuals. The mood was documentaryand the language was deliberately blunt and unliterary. Realism and naturalismwere products of the events and ideals of the 19th century which witnessed theirfinal triumph at the early part of the 20th century.With the opening of the 20th century, the exposure of injustice and abuses ofnational life became a popular literary subject. In polities the 1900s were the era ofTheodore Roosevelt's progressivism and "trust-busting" which was reflected inliterature as the era of "muckrakers," those who were accused of raking up themuch of life for all to see. The American realistic writers depicted life around themand they tried to work out new techniques to fit their new ideas. Edith Wharton（1862——1937）, in her stories and novels, was concerned about the upper-class, theworld of aristocracy in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, TheAgeof Innocence （1920）, probed the moral values and the conflict between the socialconformity and personal fulfillment. The decent people were the major characters.At about the same time, some other authors such as Theodore Dreiser（1871——1945）, Stephen Crane （1871——1900）, Hamlin Garland （1860——1940） and FrankNorris （1870——1902） showed their sympathy toward ordinary people.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
