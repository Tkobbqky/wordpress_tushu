Department of English， School of Foreign Languages and Literature，
Wuhan University. Ever since she entered the university， Feihas
indulged herselfin both English and Chinese creative writings. To
acquire a more intense appreciation on English literature， in 2011，
as an exchange student， Fei spent one semester in University of
Glasgow， where she did a cntical analysis on a couple of romantic
novels， among which Mary Shelley's Frankenstein  inspired her
profoundly. After reading Frankenstein， Fei had a peculiar dream，
in which a godlike creature， which resembles Adam in Paradise Lost，
after being energized by the lightning， wakes up and comes to life.
This scene takes place besides Loch Lomond， Scotland， where Fei
used to visit when she was staying in Glasgow. In 2013， as a salute
to Mary Shelley， the mother ofscience fiction as well as a record
on the dream， in her novel， Adam Frankenstein， Fei discussed
another possibility ofthe Frankenstein story.                                    </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
