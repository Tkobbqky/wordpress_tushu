　　In today's society， standards play a more important role than ever before. Standards promote economic development continuously， protect the rights and interests of citizens， and affect the goals of public policies such as the domestic and international trade， environment and health care. Standards have become an important foundation for social development and a critical means of state governance.　　In today's society， standards play a more important role than ever before. Standards promote economic development continuously， protect the rights and interests of citizens， and affect the goals of public policies such as the domestic and international trade， environment and health care. Standards have become an important foundation for social development and a critical means of state governance.<br/>　　China Jiliang University （CJLU） is the only undergraduate college in China's quality supervision， inspection and quarantine industry， and won the first ISO standardized higher education award. The university started the standardization education in the early 80s of last century. CJLU is one of the earliest institutions of higher learning to carry out standardization education in China， and also the first institution in China to have the right to grant a standardization undergraduate degree. Standardization Fundamentals is compiled by Professor Song Mingshun and his team from CJLU on the basis of many years of standardization education and research. It is one of the important achievements of the team in carrying out standardized scientific research and extensively implementing standardization education practice for many years. The book systematically and comprehensively reviews and elaborates the history， basic theory and the practice of standardization in China. It boldly expands and innovates the selection of technical standards' parameters， the elaboration of standardization laws， the analysis of standards and technological innovation， etc. The theory supplemented by practical operation is a new perspective of the book. The interdisciplinary of management， economics， engineering and other disciplines is a new method of the book. The application from industry to agriculture， service and other fields are the new contents of this book.
