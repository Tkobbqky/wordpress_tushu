The rapidity of China’s high-speed railway
development symbolizes the “China Speed” which is manifesting itself during the
era of Reform and Opening Up.
 
China’s high-speed railways are known for
safety, convenience and comfort – the top choice for people on the move. With
the “Four South-North” and “Four East-West” high-speed rail network taking
shape in China, the zooming high-speed trains are changing the ways people work
and live.
 
The whole world has been amazed at the speed
with which China has developed its railways. Even US President Obama once said,
“There is no reason why Europe or China should have the fastest trains.” China
is competitive worldwide in railway transportation infrastructure on the
strength of its quality production capacity, advanced technology and delivery
of value for money. The result is a brand-new calling card for Chinese
manufacturing.
 
As a witness to and participant in the
development of high-speed railways in China, the author has extensively
consulted archives, held in-depth interviews and gathered rare
behind-the-scenes data to paint a vivid picture of how China has developed its
high-speed railways. The record is one of a bittersweet journey, proving the
superiority of the socialist system in its ability to pool forces to achieve
something amazing. The new railways demonstrate the wisdom of the Chinese
people. This book showcases the benefits HSR has brought to China’s overall
development, as well as the bright prospects for the industry. The author’s
fact-driven style and compelling narrative unveil the puzzles and challenges
that accompanied the building of HSR in China, sharing unique stories both
enlightening and invigorating.

transportation reveals that, from the invention of the wheel some 6,000 years
ago, through the birth of carriages some 4,000 years ago, to the penetration of
automobiles, trains, steam boats and planes into people’s lives, means of
transportation have been transforming mankind’s living space and life styles at
an ever-accelerating pace. HSR (high-speed railway) is credited with
lengthening people’s lives by enabling fast travel to save people’s time.
 
“China Speed”
drives the progress of the times. “China Speed” is attracting more and more
attention around the world, especially by means of the development of HSR in
China. This country is the global leader in HSR bridges, tunnels and roadbeds,
as well as track structure and EMU technology. On the whole, China boasts the
cutting edge in the general design, construction, operation and technology of
HSR, as measured by the five indicators of safety, reliability, applicability,
cost-efficiency and advanced technology.
 
Currently, China is home to the HSR network
with the longest operating mileage and biggest construction scale in the world.
China is one of the global leaders in HSR technology, which has become a
cultural icon showcasing “China Speed.” The country’s HSR also underpins “China
Creation,” “China Intelligence,” “China Strength,” “China Pride” and “China
Spirit.” China HSR is changing the landscape not only of China but of the whole
world. HSR enable people to enjoy comfortable journeys around the world in a
safe and convenient way. </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Wang Xiong graduated from the Suzhou
