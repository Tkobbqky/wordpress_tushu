Having an amulet can bring some reassurance to a lonely traveler trekking on a mountain path at night. However modernized life can be, Chinese still have great reverence towards the unknown. 
Some mothers like to pay tribute to temples. All they wish for is safety and peace. They would get amulets from the temple and give them to every member of the family. This is not a gift of superstition. It is laden with the care of a loving mother. Such a mother is in fact the amulet of the family.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
这是一本轻松的大众流行读物，清晰的图像加上精炼的短文，完全契合了现代人的快速阅读习惯。
