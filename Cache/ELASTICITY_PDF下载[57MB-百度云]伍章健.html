  《ELASTICITY》主要内容：The purpose of this book is to introduce the basic knowledge about the classic elasticity theories and the associated research achievements by the authors. The whole book is constructed on the basis of the course syllabuses and the con-tents of elasticity used in the past few years at Beijing Institute of Technology, China and the University of Manchester,UK. In order to meet the requirement of bilingual pedagogic development in higher education, and with reference tosome classic textbooks on elasticity and newly-obtained teaching and learning outputs, such a content arrangement of this book can currently be more appropriate and convenient for readers to study elasticity under the dual-language environment.By reading this book as well as other relevant Chinese-version textbooks, the readers should be able to com-mand the fundamental knowledge of elasticity, comprehend some related standard technical terms and enhance their level of professional English. The book is intended for senior undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students,especially for engineering mechanics students, of higher education engineering institutes. It can also be consideredas an English reference for engineers, researchers and novices.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>

  《ELASTICITY》主要介绍弹性力学的经典内容和作者的*新研究成果，整个结构体系综合了北京理工大学和英国曼彻斯特大学多年来在弹性力学教学中的大纲、内容和成果。为适应当前高等教育对双语教学的发展需求，《ELASTICITY》内容的安排和撰写参考了相关专业的经典著作和*新教研成果。通过使用和阅读《ELASTICITY》，并结合相关专业的中文版教材，读者能够学到弹性力学的基础知识，标准术语，提高专业英语能力。《ELASTICITY》可作为工科类高等院校力学专业的高年级本科生和研究生双语课的教材，还可作为相关领域工程师、研究人员和初学者的专业英语参考书。
