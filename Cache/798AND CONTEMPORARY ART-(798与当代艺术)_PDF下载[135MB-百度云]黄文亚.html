  插图：As mentioned before, Li Xiangqun played an important role for the preservation of798. In 2004, 798 came close to being shut down. As a deputy of the Beijing MunicipalPeople's Congress, O Xiangqun submitted a bill dealing with the protection of historicindustrial architectural structures and the protection of the growing cultural industo'. Hisbill played a pivotal role in 798's salvation. At the mention of his title as "deputy," Li justsmiled. He was humble about his position in the local people's congress, regarding it asan opportunity to champion vulnerable people; he grew up in a poor family. He hadmost certainly performed a valuable service for a number of artists.Li Xiangqun separated artists into three categories: one group is the artists in the stateart administration institutions, such as the painting institute and the art society. Theyare paid by the government and work mainly for the government. Their works havefew personal touches. Another group is the "SoHo artists," who are unattached toany institute and therefore have more independent ideas. The third group incorpo-rates the ideas of the other two, combining traditional concepts with individuality. LiXiangqun is an academy artist. At school, he is a teacher, in 798, he is part of a com-munity of artists.</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>    in china, if you have exhibited at 798, you have "made it" as an artist. relatively little-known outside china until very recently, every travel guide on china now mentions 798. it has captured the attention of the international art world and is developing into a major cultural phenomenon.<br/>    as this book shows, 798 is the result of a unique cultural paradox: as china embraces more and more individual artistic freedom, this is combined with china's long, collectivist history gf "doing work together." for the artists who have exhibited at 798,their association has become a badge of legitimacy within the art world and often a passport to worldwide acclaim. this book offers a revealing first-look behind the artistic and cultural phenomenon that is at the vanguard of contemporary chinese art.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
