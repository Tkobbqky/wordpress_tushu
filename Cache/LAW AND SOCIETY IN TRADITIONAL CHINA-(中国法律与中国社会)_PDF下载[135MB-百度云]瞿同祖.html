<p>书名:LAW AND SOCIETY IN TRADITIONAL CHINA-(中国法律与中国社会)</p><p>作者:瞿同祖</p><p>页数:416</p><p>定价:¥79.0</p><p>出版社:商务印书馆</p><p>出版日期:2011-12-01</p><p>ISBN:9787100084864</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　the statement that china is passing through an unprecedent-ed
revolution has almost become a platitude， but its very obviousness
in no way diminishes its truth. the changes which this huge and
venerable country experienced in the past are negligible when
compared with the developments of the last decade. the reason for
this difference in degree-which amounts to a qualitative change-is
that developments in the past hardly influenced fundamentals, if
they ever did so at all, whereas the present transformation deeply
affects them. it is even consciously aimed at changing the social
structure and all that this entails.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
