  《亚太地区橡胶木加工技术的推广(英文版)》内容简介：Demonstration of rubberwood processing technology and promotion of sustainable development in China and other Asian countries and the book was edited on the base of the Proceedings of the ITTO/CFC International Rubberwood Workshop held in Haikou, China from December 8 to 10, 2008. The project was implemented by the Research Institute of Wood Industry, Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF) from 2006 to 2008,with the assistance of General Bureau of Hainan State Farms (GBHSF) and Hainan State Farms Woodworking Co.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：1.4.2 Environmental concept strengthenedIn the past,the main preservative used in almost all sawmills was NaPCP, which was greatly harmful to environment. Through this project, many environmental friendly preservatives were introduced, such as boron based preservatives and FB, F1,F2, WF-03 anti-mould formulas.1.4.3 Improvement of preservation techniqueThrough this project,new measurement meter was introduced to industrials for online detecting and adjusting the solute concentration, which could more precisely control the preservative absorption, not only to keep the treatmentquality,but also to save cost.1.5 Strategies for the promotion of rubberwood industry development. （1） Rational allocation of resources to ensure sustainable supply of rubberwood. The rubber plant is mainly for producing rubber,it should be integratedlymanaged with considering the integrated profits of forest output, rubber treespecies,trees planting and cutting programming. Besides the yield of latex, theyield and quality of rubberwood should also be considered.（2） The management and processing techniques should be strengthened, andthe different processing scales should be supported. The processing scaledepends on collection and supply ways of rubberwood log. Currently, therubberwood processing technology is not good in China, technique support isessential for a better processing. For some places,more efficient and larger-scalemanufacture is encouraged to be established. In this way, the rubberwood couldbe used in more efficient and environment-friendly way.（3） Promoting the production of dimension timber. To produce thedimension timber or non-dimension timber is depending on the processingtechnique and rubberwood supply quality in different factories. To produce moredimension timber is encouraged since it usually means a good quality and moreadded values.（4） The improvement in rubberwood preservative treatment techniques andsawn timber quality. The rubberwood is easily decayed and moulded. Exposed inthe open air,the green log with bark will be decayed in 1-2 months, the timberwill be moulded in 7-10 days. Therefore, if the rubberwood can not be processedin time,it must be treated by preservatives. Presently the timber colour will bebrowning after the treatment, which degrades the quality of the timber. Inaddition,the application of preservatively treated wood is restricted due to thesafety reason. All these need technique improvement in preservative treatmentand drying.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
