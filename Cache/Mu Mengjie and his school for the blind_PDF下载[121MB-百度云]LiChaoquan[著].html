Later in life, he returned home and established a special education school for the visually impaired. The school welcomed anyone who had a visual impairment, never charging them a penny.

Mu Mengjie was a blind farmer who lived in Dongxinzhai Village, in a town called Ping Xiang in Hebei Province. Though he never received any formal education, Mengjie’s dream from a young age was to live a respectable, meaningful life. With a bamboo stick in hand, he ventured out at age 13 and made a living as a street performer, tasting all the bitterness the world had to offer. With perseverance and passion, he became a storyteller, well known in cities like Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and earned his first “pot of gold” in life. Once Mengjie became a millionaire, no one expected that he would be so determined to open a school for the blind in his hometown. His school would accept anyone who was visually impaired regardless of their condition and charged no fees. Students could continue to study at the<br/>school until they mastered their skills. With a pure mind and a kind heart, Mengjie offered lots of help which benefited many blind people and their families. </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>李朝全，中国作协报告文学委员会委员、中国报告文学学会副会长。著有纪实文学《最好的时代》《国家书房》《梦想照亮生活》《世纪知交——巴金与冰心》，曾获庄重文文学奖、中国人口文化奖。
