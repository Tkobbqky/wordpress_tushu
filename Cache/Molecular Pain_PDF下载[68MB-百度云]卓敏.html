SUMMARY<br/>
Reversible protein phosphorylation is the most<br/>
prominent posttranslational regulatory mechanism<br/>
in eukaryotes. Protein kinases catalyze the addition<br/>
of a phosphoester group to proteins while protein<br/>
phosphatases oppose kinase activity by removing<br/>
phosphates. The recent sequencing of numerous<br/>
genomes has allowed for the identification and<br/>
classification of most if not all kinases and phos-<br/>
phatases. Kinases represent a large group of en-<br/>
zymes (&gt;500 in humans) and are classified by se-<br/>
quence similarity, with most kinases containing a<br/>
conserved catalytic domain. Phosphatases are a<br/>
smaller group (-140 in humans) and are classified<br/>
by their catalytic mechanisms, as well as sequence<br/>
similarity. Most kinases and phosphatases contain<br/>
domains involved in intramolecular regulation of<br/>
the catalytic domain. In contras</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
</p>, <p>Molecular Pain is the first book to focus on molecular and synaptic<br/>
mechanisms for pain transmission, modulation and plasticity. Unlike<br/>
traditional textbooks about pain, this book covers recent progress in<br/>
neuroscience and relates these developments to the basic mechanisms of<br/>
chronic pain. The book also discusses current pain medicine and alternative<br/>
pain treatments such as acupuncture.<br/>
Edited by a leading neuroscientist and pain researcher, Molecular Pain<br/>
includes contributions by more than thirty international science experts<br/>
from eight different countries. The book's thirty-four chapters cover a wide<br/>
spectrum of pain, analgesia, and neuroscience, and present chronic pain as a<br/>
major health concern and a dynamic area of research.<br/>
Complete with 165 illustrations, Molecular Pain is a concise and<br/>
comprehensive review of recent progress in the field of pain. This book<br/>
is an invaluable reference work and textbook for advanced undergraduate<br/>
students, graduate and medical students, and researchers in neuroscience,<br/>
pain, animal behavior, anesthesiology and medicine.<br/>
