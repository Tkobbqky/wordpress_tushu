　　the lexical meaning of housing is a building that protects men
from natural  harms such as rain, wind, cold and heat and
social harms such as theft and destruction. it is not an
over-statement to say that human history had begun together with
housing. men cannot live without housing.
　　being faithful to basic is always the most important. therefore,
i believe it is quite meaningful to collect the housing of the
world, which 'is the foundation of architecture and the essence of
living, and introduce them tothe readers.
　　the five olympic rings which symbolize five continents are the
motif of this. book. in the olympic rings, the blue, yellow, black,
green and red rings from left are overlapped in w-shape. likewise,
this book introduces the multi- family housing recently completed
in europe, america, oceania and asia. the concept of family is also
changing now and this book tries to suggest the future direction of
housing by showing the rapidly changing concepts on housing and
residence by way of showing recently completed architectural
works.
　　i sincerely hope that %housing" will become one of the bases in
learning the housing trend in korea and overseas to the readers. it
wou{d be my pleasure if readers would get useful information and
wise insight from this book.
　　as last, i would like to express my sincere appreciation to the
architects and owners who helped us with information and
photographing opportunities. i promise that the archiworld will
continue to provide dear readers with solid contents and great
editing. meanwhile, your continuous interest and support would be
highly appreciated.
