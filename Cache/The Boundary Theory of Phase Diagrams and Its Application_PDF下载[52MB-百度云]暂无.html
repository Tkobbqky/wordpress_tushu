This innovative boundary theoryhas solved many difficulties in understanding phase diagrams, and alsofinds its application in constructing multi-component phase diagrams orin calculating high-pressure phase diagrams. Researchers and engineers aswell as graduate students in the areas of chemistry, metallurgy and materialsscience will benefit from this book.Prof. Muyu Zhao was the recipient of the 1998 Prize for Progress in Scienceand Technology （for his work on the boundary theory of phase diagrams）awarded by the National Commission of Education, China, and many otherprizes.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>插图：Chapter 1 The Phase Rule, Its Deduction andApplication1.1	Why do We Discuss the Phase Rule at FirstThe Gibbs phase rule is now a long established principle of Chemistry, very wellknown by all physical chemists and materials scientists. So, why do we still need towrite a chapter to discuss this classic, fundamental law of Chemical science, at theoutset of this treatise？Textbooks, as published for the explanation of physical chemistry and the useof phase diagrams, usually present only a simple method for the "deduction" of thephase rule. However, the original "rule" as deduced by Gibbs himself, is both strictand well thought-out, indeed students can learn much from his method. The Gibbs-Roozebooms method, though simple, is, nevertheless, full of wisdom. The deductionof the phase rule under the circumstance, involving particular chemical reactions,by application of the mathematicM method of Gibbs free energy minimization, istoday, only presented in a few monographs. By means of this method however, boththe phase rule, and the law of mass action used for the chemical equilibrium, aresuccessfully deduced. This is indeed a very interesting circumstance.When applying the phase rule, an important and difficult problem to treat isthe determination of the number of independent components involved. Generally,ordinary Physical Chemistry texts only present Jouguet's method for the deductionof this number and do not discuss either the strengths and or the shortcomings, ofthis method. Here, we present another useful approach, i.e. that of the Brinkley'smethod and these two methods will be shortly compared in detail.The application of the phase rule is generally not a very easy task, so here wewill also address some brief remarks to the resolution of this problem.Usually, we apply the phase rule and then discuss the differences between thephase rule predictions and our theory, as set out in detail </p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
