Ducks are  immune to some common diseases found in hens and are less vulnerable to others. Some breeds  of duck produce bigger eggs than hens, In addition, ducks lay eggs over a longer season than do  hens.<br/>Poultry keepers with gardens have less to worry about if they keep ducks rather than hens  because the former are less apt to dig up plants and destroy roots. While both hens and ducks  benefit the garden by eating pests, hens are known to damage herb and grass beds. Ducks, on the  other hand, will search for insects and snails more carefully. Only very delicate plants are at risk  from the broad, webbed feet of ducks.<br/>Like all water-birds, ducks need access to water, and cluck keepers typically provide this by  building a pond. Something this large is not absolutely necessary, however; ducks need only to be  able to dip their heads in the water to keep their nostrils clean. If a pond is provided, though, it  is important to keep ducklings away from it until they are old enough to withstand the cool  temperature of the water——about eight weeks.<br/>When keeping ducks, one has to consider just how many the land will support. Generally  the rule is 100 ducks per half hectare. If more than this proportion is introduced, there is a risk of compacting the soil, which can lead to muddy conditions for long periods as the rain is not easily absorbed into the ground.<br/>While ducks offer many advantages over hens, they must be given a greater quantity of food, especially if regular eggs are desired. An adult duck will eat between 170 to 200 grams of food a day. If the ducks have access to grass and a pond, they will be-able to find for themselves approximately 70% of their daily dietary requirements in warmer months but less than half that in colder times. Therefore, it is important that they be fed enough food, such as grain, every day.<br/>Experienced duck keep<br/></p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
