The study of evasive answer is of theoretical significance because a new theory-the relevance theory is applied to this research， and it is also of applicable importance because evasion is a common strategy used by politicians to deal with sticky questions. The cultural interpretation， then， could further explain the value differentiation and similarities between the manifestations of Sino-US diplomatic discourses. During those explorations， different theories from the interdisciplinary perspective would be applies in the data observation and analysis. Theories of identity， nationalism as well as cognitive pragmatics could be used to shed light on the research object.　　As for the cognitive theoretical framework， since this study intends to explain how cognitive context works in our minds to successfully generate the evasive answer， the intended theoretical value is to refine theories on evasive answers， which could enable us to access to a better understanding of the conception of evasiveness. Because this study is intended to abstract a model of evasively answering under the guideline of the Relevance Theory， in this sense， the present study will also be contributed to the possible significance of theoretical construction.　　Besides， this theoretical significance could directly bring about the applicable significance. As to application， the present study will also provide diplomatic respondents with ostensive information to tackle different questions， especially those implicational leading questions. In other words， it will also show how to use those theories in real political environments to become a better spokesperson or politician， especially in the circumstances of Sino-US cultural comparisons and contrasts. Thus， the present book will also be of some applicable significance by suggesting concrete ways to solve the answering problems in political context.　　4.1 Discussions on the Basis of Framework　　The purpose of the present chapter is to present and explain the conceptual framework that is developed via observing and examining the data collected for the present study. It starts with a brief synopsis of the problems in the existing studies on evasion so as to lay the foundation and to understand the necessity of our proposing a conceptual framework of evasion from the cognitive pragmatic perspective. The present conceptual framework， intends to explain how answerers can successfully use evasive strategies via the Relevance Theory， and the concept of cognitive context in Relevance Theory will be attempted to develop by the application in analyzing evasive strategies in diplomatic discourses， Thus， we can further analyze the mechanism underlying evasion in it.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《“闪避回答”的文化研究：以中美新闻发言为例（英文）》主要内容包括Introduction，Literature Review and Conceptual Construction，Methodology，The Theoretical Framework，Cognitive Pragmatic Analysis of Evasive Answers in Press Conferences，Evasive Strategies to Different Questions in Press Conferences，Pragmatic Functions of Evasive Answers in Press，The Comparative Analysis of Evasive Strategies in Sino-US Press Conferences，The Cultural Analysis of the Evasive Differentiations in Sino-US Press Conferences，Conclusion。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
