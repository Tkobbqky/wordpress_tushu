Her contribution to the theory of the growth of the firm has reinvented and productively developed the classical tradition in econonucs. There are two approaches to reading Penrose: the main one is the Resource-Based View; the second one， a newer reading emerging， is the Subjectvism-Based View. This book seeks to contribute to the latter.　　This book provides with a re-reading of Penrose's The Theory of the Growth of the Firm （1959） through a subjectivismlens. It creates a new mode of discovery for the fundamental source of firm behavior and growth.This book will be invaluable to those wanting to explore the striking originality and farreaching legacy of Penrose's work at the criticalintersection of economics an management， It has the potential to shift the focus of business research and practice from peripheral environmental factors to the internal mental development' of individual entrepreneurial managers to promote the growth of the firm.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Chen Zheng is a lecturer in the School of Business Administration.
