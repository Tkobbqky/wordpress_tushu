Micro:bit是有BBC推出的面向全球青少年编程学习及STEM教育的学习工具。在众多的软件和硬件中（Scratch、Arduino、Lego、Python……），一直没有一个完善的课堂学习编程的解决方案，Micro:bit解决了这一问题，不但身形小巧，结构简单，其硬件传感器高集成化，且图形代码结合的编程方式使其已经迅速风靡全球，目前即将登陆亚洲。学生能够通过短时间学习后，迅速掌握它的使用方法，并应用于数学、艺术、科学、技术、生活、机器人等活动中，启发他们创意思维。国内目前讲解Micro:bit的图书还未发现，国外也刚刚出现，本书采用简单明了的讲述方式，结合实际操作环境，选取了大量生动的实例，使学习者快速了解和上手操作，并能独立设计小应用。
