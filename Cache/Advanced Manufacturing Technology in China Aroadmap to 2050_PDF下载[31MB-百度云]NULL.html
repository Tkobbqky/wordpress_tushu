  《中国至2050年先进制造科技发展路线图(英文版)》内容简介：As one of the eighteen field-specific reports comprising the comprehensive scope of the strategic general report of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this sub-report addresses long-range planning for developing science and technology in the field of advanced manufacturing technology. They each craft a roadmap for their sphere of development to 2050. In their entirety, the general and sub-group reports analyze the evolution and laws governing the development of science and technology, describe the decisive impact of science and technology on the modernization process, predict that the world is on the eve of an impending S&amp;T revolution, and call for China to be fully prepared for this new round of S&amp;T advancement. Based on the detailed study of the demands on S&amp;T innovation in Chinas modernization, the reports drawa framework for eight basic and strategic systems of socio-economic development with the support of science and technology, work out Chinas S&amp;T roadmaps for the relevant eight basic and strategic systems in line with Chinas reality, further detail S&amp;T initiatives of strategic importance to Chinas modernization, and provide S&amp;T decision-makers with comprehensive consultations for the development of S&amp;T innovation consistent with Chinas reality. Supported by illustrations and tables of data, the reports provide researchers, government officials and entrepreneurs with guidance concerning research directions, the planning process, and investment.Founded in 1949, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the nation's highest a cademicinstitution in natural sciences. Its major responsibilities are to conduct research in basic and technological sciences, to undertake nationwide integrated surveys on natural resources and ecological environment, to provide the country with scientificdata and consultations for government's decision-making, to undertake government-assigned projects with regard to key S&amp;T problems in the process of socio-economic development, to initiate personnel training, and to promote Chinas high-techenterprises through its active engagement in these areas.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  Automation of information processing and application has a great effecton promoting the development of national economy, greatly accelerates the process of industrialization, remarkably improves material living standard of people, and changes the production and operation management modeof enterprises from the past extensive management gradually to the precisemanagement. The networking of information applications, on one hand significantly improved people's production and living standards, on the other hand has profound impact on people's production and lifestyle. With the application of e-commerce, enterprise resource planning, supply chainmanagement, product lifecycle management, etc., the management and operation mode of enterprises have been profoundly changed, the advancedmanufacturing models such as agile manufacturing, concurrent engineering,mass customization, network collaborative design and manufacturing, as wellas advanced management models such as business process reengineering, flatorganizational structure, learning-oriented enterprises have emerged.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
