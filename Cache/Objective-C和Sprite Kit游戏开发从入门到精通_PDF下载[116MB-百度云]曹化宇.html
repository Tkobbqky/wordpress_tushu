本书是一线程序员凝聚自己多年开发经验的结晶之作，深入浅出地讲解Objective-C语言、
Foundation框架、Sprite Kit框架，以及其他开发iOS和Mac游戏所需要的基础知识，帮助读者零基础实践
iOS和Mac游戏开发。
本书内容可以分为四个部分，*部分（第1～5章）介绍如何使用Xcode和Objective-C语言编写程
序；第二部分（第6～12章）讨论Foundation框架中常用的开发资源，这些资源不但可以为游戏开发服
务，同样也可以应用于各种类型的iOS或OS X应用开发；第三部分（第13～18章）讨论Sprite Kit在游戏
开发中的应用；第四部分（第19～23章）讨论游戏开发相关的技术，如网络状态检测、Game Center排
行榜、应用内购买等。
本书内容安排合理，架构清晰，注重理论与实践相结合，适合作为零基础学习iOS和Mac游戏开发
的初学者的教程，也适合作为有一定编程基础的程序员的参考手册。
