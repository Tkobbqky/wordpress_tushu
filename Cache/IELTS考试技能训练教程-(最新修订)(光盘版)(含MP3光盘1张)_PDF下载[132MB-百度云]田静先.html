Pair Work (I)<br/>
      The pair-work activities are arranged for two students to work together. In<br/>
these activities, student A and student B are given definite roles to play in a parti-<br/>
cular situation. If student A has one particular role or task in the first activity,<br/>
then he or she has student B' s role or task in the second and vice versa. This<br/>
gives both students practice in the same function--asking and answering ques-<br/>
tions. In the pair-work activities, student A and student B are given different<br/>
cards. Student A should find out the information about the items listed on the card<br/>
by asking questions. Student B will answer student A' s questions based on the in-<br/>
formation given on his or her card.<br/>
