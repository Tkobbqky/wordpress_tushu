《格桑梅朵》是解放后中国藏族作家创作的*部长篇小说。格桑梅朵，意为“幸福花”，它是本书中一对青年男女边巴和娜真纯洁爱情的寄托，也是藏族人民向往“吉祥如意”的象征。该书以1950年到1951年西藏和平解放历史事件为背景，以边巴和娜真的爱情为主线，通过细腻的笔触叙述了西藏从黑暗走向光明、从落后走向进步、从贫穷走向富裕、从专制走向民主、从封闭走向开放的伟大划时代变革和光辉历程。
Kelsang Metok is the first full-length novel created by a Chinese Tibetan writer. Kelsang Metok or “flower of happiness” symbolizes the pure love between the hero Bamba and the heroine Nachi. It also highlights the Tibetan people’s aspirations for “good luck and happiness”. Taking their love as the main thread, this book tells the historical events of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) entering Tibet and the eventual peaceful liberation of the region in the period of 1950-1951. It details how the PLA and Tibetan people worked together to achieve this epoch-making change. After the peaceful liberation, Tibet moved from cultural and material backwardness to progress, from autocracy to democracy, and from a closed society to one opening up to the outside world.

Jampel Gyatso was born in the Tibetan-inhabited area of western Sichuan Province which was liberated when the PLA marched into Tibet. Like many youngsters of the Tibetan ethnic group, after an initial period of terror and confusion caused by ignorance, he resolutely joined the PLA and marched with it into Tibet. On the way, he engaged in the mass work with his ethnic compatriots and reached Lhasa . So, he became familiar with the whole process of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and had a profound understanding of the whole transformation process of Tibetan people from initial misgivings to great joy at the PLA’s arrival. Kelsang Metok draws materials from the historical events of the PLA march into Tibet. It reviews that history through the eyes of the Tibetan people, naturally carrying readers to the mysterious and ancient Tibetan Plateau. In this book, the actions of these “soldiers of the Bodhisattva”, the turbulence and changes in various fields of the almost stagnant society dominated by feudal serfdom, as well as the yearning and pursuits of various characters of different classes and social strata are closely observed from the psychological perspective of the Tibetan people. The epoch-making significance of this historical event finds vivid expression in the social development of Tibet. </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>降边嘉措，中国社会科学院少数民族文学研究所研究员，《格萨尔》研究中心主任，中国社会科学院研究生院少数民族文学所博士生导师，从事当代藏学问题、少数民族文学研究，并发表多部文学作品。
