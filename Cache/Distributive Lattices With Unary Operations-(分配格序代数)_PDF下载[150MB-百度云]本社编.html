and theoretical computer science, lattice-ordered algebraic
structure theory has played a more and more important role in
theoretical and applied science. not only is it an important branch
of modern mathematics, but it also has broad and important
applications in algebra, topology, fuzzy mathematics and other
applied sciences such as coding theory, computer programs,
multi-valued logic and science of information systems, etc. the
research in distributive lattices with unary operations has made
great progress in the past three decades, since joel berman first
introduced the distributive lattices with an additional unary
operation in 1978, which were named ockham algebras by goldberg a
year later. this is due to those researchers who are working on
this subject, such as adams, beazer, berman, blyth, davey,
goldberg, priestley, sankappanavar and varlet.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
