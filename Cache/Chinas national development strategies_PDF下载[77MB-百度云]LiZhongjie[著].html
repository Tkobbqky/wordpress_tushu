<p>书名:Chinas national development strategies</p><p>作者:Li Zhongjie[著]</p><p>页数:22,627页</p><p>定价:¥148.0</p><p>出版社:外文出版社</p><p>出版日期:2019-03-01</p><p>ISBN:9787119114156</p><p><h2>节选</h2></p>[<p>　　In this war waged by fascist aggressors， the Japanese occupied large swathes of land in Northeast， North， Central and South China， which were the country's strategic areas of the greatest economic， political and cultural importance. The occupiers committed heinous crimes， inflicting huge suffering and losses on the Chinese nation. China was the country most devastated by the war.　　The Chinese people suffered more than 35 million casualUes during the war. In terms of 1937 value， China's direct economic losses amount-ed to USD100 billion， and indirect economic losses reached USD500 billion.　　This data may seem too general. Behind the data， however， there are numerous facts and conclusive evidence that constitute the painful mem-ories of blood and tears of countless Chinese people. Over a period of a decade starung from October 2004， the Party History Research Center of the CPC Central Committee orgaruzed more than 600，000 people in the Party history and other departments across the country to carry out large-scale research on the subject of China's casualties and property losses during the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression， in an effort to restore this period of history in a direct， con-crete， comprehensive， systematic and multi-dimensional way， to show the disasters and losses suffered by the Chinese people， and to expose the crimes of the Japanese militarists. As one who played a key role in this survey， I designed the research plan and organized and pushed forward the whole process of the research.　　Our main method was to consult and collect various archives includ-ing the newspapers and magazines of that period and the results of years of research. Concerning some specific and major events， we visited the people involved， witnesses， and relevant researchers， recorded testimony，and sought judicial notarization where possible. Our survey was carried out both horizontally and vertically， which means that every province， au-tonomous region， or municipality directly under the central government was responsible for surveying casualties and property losses within its own jurisdicUon， and the investigation work was done from the prefec-tural or county level down through to township and even village level.For some important issues involving multiple localities， such as pressed labor， germ warfare， chemical warfare， sex slaves， refugees， and overseas Chinese， we organized experts to conduct special research. We also sent teams to the United States， Russia， Japan and other countries to collect archives. In addition， research groups from 17 provinces and equivalent administrative units went to Taiwan to consult files. They received sup-port from relevant institutions and personnelin Taiwan.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　China's development alid progress has been realized through a series of national strategies.
