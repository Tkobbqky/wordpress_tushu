Qin Fang、Hao Wu*的《Concrete  Structures under Projectile Impact(精)》， the authors present their theoretical,  experimental and numerical investigations  into concrete structures subjected to  projectile and aircraft impacts in recent  years. Innovative approaches to analyze the  rigid, mass abrasive and eroding projectile  penetration and perforation are proposed.  Damage and failure analyses of nuclear power  plant containments impacted by large  commercial aircrafts are numerically and  experimentally analyzed. Ultra-high  performance concrete materials and  structures against the projectile impact are  developed and their capacities of resisting  projectile impact are evaluated. This book  is written for the researchers, engineers  and graduate students in the fields of  protective structures and terminal  ballistics.
