　　the most comprehensive, impactful collection of photography in
china to date, contemporary chinese photographic arts is a
vibrantly printed, oversized coffee table book featuring fifty of
the most renowned chinese photographers currently working in a
variety of genres. from documentary photography to conceptual
tableaus, from medium format portraits to digitally manipulated
dream scenes, from black and white to enhanced color, the works in
this volume are designed to provoke and impress. an introductory
segment analyzes political, economic, historic, and artistic
influences in china, which segues into intensely creative work
organized by theme: urbanization and globalization; power, space
and memory; gender, body, and identity; dialogues with tradition;
borderlands and the marginal; and practices of looking. the third
section of the book summarizes key happenings in the development of
chinese photography, including influential exhibitions, auctions,
and events. the pieces presented are unified by the masterful
technique of the photographers and, collected together, serve as a
multifaceted view into the culture, identity, ideas, and spatial
and political concepts of one of the world's most influential
nations.
