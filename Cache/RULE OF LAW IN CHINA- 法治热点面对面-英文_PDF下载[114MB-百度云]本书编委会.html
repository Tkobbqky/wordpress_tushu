Such phenomena mirror the problem that departments and regions pursue their own interests in making laws.　　Why does such a problem arise? In the final analysis, it appears as a result of the shortcomings of the current system. China is a unified and multi-ethnic socialist country that practices a unitary system. However, soaal and economic development is imbalanced from region to region. Proceeding from this basic condition, China's Consutution defines a unified and tiered legislation system.The Law on Legislation regulates the legislative issues in an all-round way, including defining the limits of legislative powers of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the central and local authorities, legislative procedure, applicability, filing for record and reviewing of the laws. With continuous progress made in social and economic development and reform, the legislative work has come to encounter new circumstances and problems.It is therefore necessary to further improve the legislative system,mechanism and procedures in accordance with the requirement of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《法治热点面对面（英文版）》作为中宣部理论局组织编写的“通俗理论读物”系列之一，深入解读了中国共产党的十八届四中全会《决定》，就中国法治建设的道路、司法公正、党和法治的关系、依法治国和以德治国的关系、党规党纪为何严于国法等一系列现实问题作出了入情入理的回答。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
