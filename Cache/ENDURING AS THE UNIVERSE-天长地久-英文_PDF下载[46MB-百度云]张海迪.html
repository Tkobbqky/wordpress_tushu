长篇小说《天长地久》，是作家张海迪继《轮椅上的梦》《绝顶》之后的又一力作。海迪在小说的前言里有一句话：“很多年来，我一直有一个愿望——在我还能握住笔的时候，写一部关于星空的书。这个愿望来自我童年时对天空的冥想，也是成年后对时光飞逝如梭的怅惘。”她以女性少有的宏大气魄描绘了无边的宇宙星空和壮阔的自然景象，塑造了天文学家杜克成、河流学家曾在平、雕塑家余锦菲、动物学家朱丽宁等别具尊严和精神的知识分子形象，深刻而理性地探照了现代人的心灵。
The long novel, Enduring as the Universe, is another masterpiece by Zhang Haidi following her Dream on Wheelchair and The Topmost. Zhang explains the reason for writing the book in the Preface: “I have long cherished a dream—writing a book about the sky dotted with stars—before I couldn’t even hold a pen. Actually, it originates from my childhood meditation about the sky and it also mirrors my adult regret over the passing of time.” She depicted an immense universe with boundless starry sky and splendid natural landscape. She also created a number of roles pursuing individual dignity and high spirit, such as Du Kecheng, an astronomer, Zeng Zaiping, an expert in potamology, Yu Jinfei, a sculptress, and Zhu Lining, a zoologist. These roles will lead the readers to deeply and rationally explore the minds of the modern people.

Every person across the globe has to live through worries, expectations, desires and disillusions. A lifetime is just a very short journey in the vast universe. It will soon vanish as a meteor. However, people have never stopped looking for the answers to the questions in their hearts, even though they may encounter difficulties and feel exhausted and confused on the way. What the people want is a return with definite answers. Then, the journey is worthwhile. </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>张海迪，1955年9月生，中国山东济南人。作家、中国作家协会全国委员会委员。曾任山东省作家协会副主席兼创作室主任。已出版：长篇小说《轮椅上的梦》《绝顶》《天长地久》；散文集《生命的追问》《我的德国笔记》《美丽的英语》《不沉的船》；翻译作品《丽贝卡在新学校》《莫多克——一头大象的真实故事》《一只旧箱子》。另出版有《海迪自选集》（六卷本）。2008年当选中国残疾人联合会主席。
