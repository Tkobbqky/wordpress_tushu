On 4 December 2016, the letter given by President Xi Jinping to the International Symposium on the 30th anniversary for adopting the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development states that: "Development is an eternal theme for the human race. The UN declaration affirms that the right to development is an inalienable human right...China regards development as the key to solving all problems and the primary task for the Communist Party of China in governing and rejuvenating the country. China insists on a combination of the principle of universality of human rights and the nation's actual conditions, and insists that the rights to live and development are primary basic human rights. For years China has put the people first during its development, increasing their benefits, ensuring the people are their own masters and supporting development in an all-round way. These are both the starting points and the goals of development. China has effectively safeguarded the people's right to development and carved out a human rights development path with C,hinese characteristics. China has actively participated in global governance and made great efforts to promote inclusive development, striving to create conditions and opportunities for all countries, especially developing countries, so that they may share the fruits of  evelopment. On 5 December 2016, Beijing Proposal was adopted, and it states that the right to development is a universal and inalienable general human right, and that the guarantee of the right to development is manifested in the realization of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, and also in the acquirement of civil and political rights. The intemational community should therefore attach equal importance to the promotion and protection of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights as well as civil and political rights. The right to development is an individual as well as a collectiv right. Governments are obliged to keep improving conditions to facilitate the development of all nations and individuals, and the right to development requires sustainability. Countries, societies and individuals should all bear obligations and responsibilities for sustainable development. To realize and guarantee the right to development, they need to conform to the concept of balanced and sustainable growth, and promote harmony between man and nature, economy and society,　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《中国促进国际法治报告（2016 英文版）》旨在系统梳理近年来国际法治的新发展，着重阐述中国在国际法治的各个重要领域所表明的理念、坚持的原则与立场和采取的具体行动，系统展示了中国对促进国际法治做出的重要贡献。《中国促进国际法治报告（2016 英文版）》由两部分构成，**部分为中国与国家间关系法治，中国与国际经济关系法治，中国与国际民商事法治，以及中国国际法理论与实践的国际传播；第二部分集中深入梳理2016年中国在国际法某些特定领域的理论创新、制度构建和新实践。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　XIAO Yongping, PhD in law, Cheung Kong Scholars Distinguished Professor. now acts as director of Internationai Law Institute (a national Think Tank) at Wuhan University, also holds as standing vice- chairman of China's Society of Private International Law. standing director of China Law Society, member of International Law Committee of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC, member of Advisory Committee of Supreme People's Procuratorate of' PRC, part-time research fellow on the "Belt and Road" Initiative of the Supreme People's Court of PRC, member of review group of National Social Science Fund, and editor-in-chief of WHU' International Law Review.
