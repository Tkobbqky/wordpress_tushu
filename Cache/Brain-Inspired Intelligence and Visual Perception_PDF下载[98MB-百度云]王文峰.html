<p>书名:Brain-Inspired Intelligence and Visual Perception</p><p>作者:王文峰</p><p>页数:未知</p><p>定价:¥96.0</p><p>出版社:华中科技大学出版社</p><p>出版日期:2019-03-01</p><p>ISBN:9787568050791</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>In the 19th century, Spanish anatomists founded the theory of neurons. With the development of brain science, the biological characteristics of neurons and related electrical properties have been discovered. The advent of mathematical methods to simulate the actual human neural network in 1943 can be recognized as one of the notable landmarks. 63 years since then, deep neural networks were proposed and developed to simulate the structure of the human cerebral cortex. The emergence of deep learning has a great influence on the traditional artificial intelligence and enhanced the importance of brain-inspired intelligence in the whole field of artificial intelligence. This is a great dream into reality!  </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Wenfeng Wang is currently the leader of a CAS “Light of West China” Program (XBBS-2014-16) and has been invited as the director of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, the College of Brain-inspired Intelligence, Chinese Academy of Sciences (to be set up in Nov. 2017).
