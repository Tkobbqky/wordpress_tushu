                                        there is only one shangri-la in the world, but the appearance of
shangri-la’s legend in different eyes and hearts is really
different.
opening the book, which was written with the true experience of the
trip by mind and body, i saw not only the magnificent sceneries
lighting up the eyes, but also the devout pray and inquiry from
deep of the soul, the true emotion within the ballads and epics,
the solemn and artless folk-customs and the melancholy and anxiety
about the pure land, which might be destroyed by the modern
civilization as well. the author was singing, roaring, admiring and
sighing with his life enthusiasm like the plateau sunlight, and
each voice will hit the popular feeling, like the splendid top of
the snow mountain.
the book would be the starting point for me to access the beautiful
legend, rather than the answer to daocheng yading.

                                        these “images” surely reflect true to some extent the awakening
of local businesses and people in the sense of commodity economy，
represent the desire of the local population of affluent life，
which undoubtedly should be understood and respected， but in the
face of the “awakening” and “desire” driven and inspired by the
marketization process of many inland areas in the few decades， i
would like to say one more thing － desire is a human instinct， of
which faith is a restraint． the history of human civilization and
culture is the history of contest between desire and belief almost
from start to finish． in deep contemplation， the first and foremost
point shangri－la tells me is that the choice of the path determines
the final result． when we unreservedly share all of our development
experience to the tibetan compatriots， we have to reveal them with
no disguise our lessons， which may be more valuable for them．

                                        when completing， with a free heart and an easy pen out of the
context of day－to－day work， some retrospective and supplementary
work of the ganzi tibetan trip we took in early summer， the sense
of gratification i had all the time been inwardly longing for
didn’t come up as expected． the various thoughts tossing on my mind
at the moment， just as the mist on the summit of minya konka and
sanhuzhu holy mountain i faced over half a year ago， sometimes
thick and sometimes thin， refused to drift away all long． even the
winter sun， going through the big glass windows and shining
thoroughly into the study and on the illustration of the manuscript
in front of me —“sunshine on the golden mountain”， also could not
boot my mood to be easy and bright． what is the matter with
me？
in the main body of the book， i have been talking a lot about
daocheng yading and shangri－la． although incompetent in writing，
the role i played can at least be considered as of a primary tour
guide － the story of daocheng yading tells you， the piece of land
known as “the last shangri－la” is indeed of great beauty and even
the ultimate beauty． walking relaxed on the land， the once illusory
realm of shambhala shall become more real in your eyes， and its
tangible shape， its rhyme in your ears and its atmosphere that
surrounds you will make paradise no longer a distant dream for you．
this kind of feeling is most probably the same as rock had during
his visit here and more visitors thereafter． however， as a special
visitor with the identity of an administrator in the tourism
industry， i， at the same time when depicting the beauty of its
mountains and waters， its strong flavor and pure custom， will
inevitably have some contemplation and concern other than general
tourists．</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
