That is part of the reason for the efforts China has made towardcurbing greenhouse gas emissions and China Daily's publishing Evolutionof Green China is of tremendous importance. The Chinese media have been working hard to endure the push foraction to combat climate change, and to preserve and improve the en-vironment. Media, such as China Daily, work to ensure these goals areadvanced by society at all levels, from that of ordinary people to those ofnational and international leadership. We are all greatly indebted to theirtireless work —— work such as that which has been collected in this enlight-ening collection of China Daily's comprehensive environmental reports.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>插图：Hu also told world leaders China will seek to produce 15 percent of itsenergy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020. Much of that will come fromrenewable energy and nuclear power. He said the nation also plans to battle climate change by planting moretrees and he committed to increase forested areas by 40 million hectares. China will also develop a greener, low-carbon economy, encourage re-cycling and tapping the potential of climate-friendly technologies.m But he insisted that, despite far-reaching social and economic improve-ments in recent decades, China is still a developing country. And he said it is well down the global rankings of per capita GDP, withimbalanced domestic development. "We have been faced with tough diffi-culties and we still have a long way to go toward modernization," Hu said. Despite its developing-nation status, he said China realizes the "toughnessand urgency" of the fight against global warming and the country has madegreat strides. "And we will continue our unshakable efforts in fighting climate change,"Hu said, while urging developed countries to make good on their Kyoto Pro-tocol promise to cut emissions by five percent of their 1990 levels. Hu said Copenhagen could be a milestone for the world while callingon developed countries to transfer technology and financial support to de-veloping countries. Experts said it was the first time that China's leader had described shift-ing China's policy away from energy intensity toward carbon management. It was also the first time China had announced its mid-term goal of miti-gating climate change, even though it had not yet added numbers."The pledge of a carbon intensity cut has been embedded with tremen-dous policy implications for China's future sustainable development," saysDaniel J. Dudek, chief economist with US-based Environmental Defense.Dud</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Zhu Ling has been editor-in-chief of China Daily, China' sglobal newspaper, sinceOctober 2004.<br/>To blue the skies and clean thewater, to realize our climate-friendly goals, China needs todramatically improve publicawareness, shift toward sustain-able development and strategicallypresent itself in the cacophony ofglobal climate politics.
