li haiqing、wang xiaoqian编*的《the art of architectural 
integration of chinese and western》介绍了，applying dichotomization to "china" and 
"the west"is amiss, as realized by the perceptive literati. dissertatingabout 
"the architectural integration of chinese and western"might be an inopportune 
undertaking under thiscontext. however, as brawling between chinese medicineand 
western medicine, chinese cuisine and western dish,chinese painting and western 
painting happens almostevery day, we cannot help but have to 
acknowledgeperceptively the cultural difference conspicuously existsand impacts 
our daily lives down to minute details.
