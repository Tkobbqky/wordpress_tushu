     During recent two decades, several books or monographs concerning the climate in<br/>
China have been published. Among them, most notable are the Climate of China written<br/>
by Zhang Jiacheng and Lin Zhiguang, the General Introduction to the Climate in China,<br/>
Edited by Zhang Jiacheng and Climate of China, Edited by Tao Shiyan et al. From the<br/>
various perspectives, these books provide comprehensive knowledge of the climate of<br/>
China. They are very useful for overall understanding of this subject. However, their<br/>
readership is mainly restricted to Chinese-speaking readers due to the fact that all of<br/>
these books were written in Chinese. Later, the book of Monsoons of China by Ding Yi-<br/>
hui is written in English, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, but its main content<br/>
only deals with the East Asian monsoon and its effect on the climate in China. Now, the<br/>
present book of Climate of China is published in English, which will provide an updated<br/>
summary of the climate in China. It will be a useful reference to better understand the<br/>
recent progress in this area for English-speaking readers.<br/>
     This book highlights the following three aspects:<br/>
      (1) Climate change and variability. The major achievements in these areas obtained<br/>
by international and Chinese scientists are included in this book, especially those derived<br/>
by IPCC assessment reports. At present time, the climate change caused by the anthropo-<br/>
genic activities is of great concern for various governments and scientific communities.<br/>
This book systematically describes the regional manifestation of the global climate<br/>
change. On the other hand, the effect of ENSO events on the climate in China, especial-<br/>
ly on summer precipitation, is well illustrated. In the western literatures, this problem<br/>
has been paid to less attention, although the ENSO- monsoon relationship is a focus of<br/>
the Asian monsoon studied by numerous investigators.<br/>
      (2) Climate in the past and its linkage to the present climate in China. The book in-<br/>
cludes the discussion of major climate epochs during the last 10ka. The readers can clear-<br/>
                                 <br/>
ly see the long - term evolution of the climate in China in the context of 10ka time -<br/>
scale. This helps elucidate and understand better the formation of the present climate<br/>
condition. The part of the changes of the frequency of summer precipitation pattern dur-<br/>
ing the last millennium is very instructive in this regard.<br/>
      (3) Operational climate prediction and multiple- purpose application. This is a new<br/>
aspect compared to other books on the climate of China. Seasonal and interannual cli-<br/>
mate prediction, especially the prediction by climate models, has been described in rela-<br/>
tion to the operational use in National Climate Center, China Meteorological Adminis-<br/>
tration.<br/>
     I believe that the publication of this book will be greatly welcome by international<br/>
and Chinese readers.<br/>
