The Working conference was organized by the IFIP Working Group 7.5 of the Technical Committee on System Modeling and Optimization. It was sponsored by Central South University, Tongji University, P.R.China, and Kanagawa University, Japan. The purpose of the Working Group 7.5 is to promote modern structural system reliability and optimization theory and its applications, to stimulate research, development and application of structural system reliability and optimization theory; to assist and advance research further the dissemination and exchange of information on reliability and optimization of structural systems; and to encourage education in structural and system reliability and optimization theories. The main themes of the Working Conference were structural reliability methods, structural system reliability and risk analysis, lifetime performance, probabilistic models, engineering risk analysis and decision making, stochastic systems, reliability-based optimal design, and applications in various civil engineering domains, including infrastructure systems, wind turbines, bridges, natural hazards, and seismic analysis. The speakers included internationally established researchers and several young researchers .This volume will be invaluable to all concerned with structural system reliability and optimization, especially students, engineers, and workers in research and development.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
