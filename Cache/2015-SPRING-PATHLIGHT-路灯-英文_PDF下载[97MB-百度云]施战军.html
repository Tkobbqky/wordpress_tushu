	　　back then we sailed a big boat on the river
　　at dawn
　　back then our collars were frayed but clean
　　back then we didn't tire
　　that was when we were young
　　we were single
　　we didn't ask for wages
　　we drank river water
　　and faced the sun
　　blue corridors opened and closed
　　red-painted wheel turned behind us
　　the deck was unbearably crowded
　　strangers slept atop one another
　　back then we had no home
　　just a window
　　we had no experience
　　we were the farthest from understanding
　　the sharp prow with its ancient rust folded through foam
　　wind stung our cheeks
　　burned our eyelids as we slept on the canopy
　　motionless, we watched
　　meanders turn black beneath day's shade
　　an overpowering scent of mint flashed by
　　flaying us open
　　snowdrifts on the main road quickly go grey
　　we throw back our heads to drink,
　　swallow the sheen of great river
