　　The year 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China （PRC）.<br/>　　Over the past 70 years， under the leadership of the Communist Party of China （CPC）， the PRC has witnessed profound changes and achieved a miracle of development unprecedented in human history. In just a few decades， China has completed a course that took developed countries several hundred years. China has now become the world's second largest economy， taken care of the material needs of its nearly 1.4 billion people， and achieved moderate all-round prosperity. Its people enjoy dignity and rights previously unknown to them. This has brought tremendous change to China. It also represents remarkable progress for human society， and above all， a significant contribution on China's part to world peace and development.<br/>　　China remains the world's largest developing country， with a large population and foundations that need to be further strengthened. Some of the fundamentals in China remain unchanged， and therefore China is still facing a raft of severe challenges. The Chinese people still have work to do.　　The year 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China （PRC）.<br/>　　Over the past 70 years， under the leadership of the Communist Party of China （CPC）， the PRC has witnessed profound changes and achieved a miracle of development unprecedented in human history.

Multipolarity， economic globalization， cultural diversity and information technology are extending their reach. Peace and development remain the themes of the times. At the same time， deep-seated problems are apparent throughout the world， with increasing instability and uncertainties. Building a global community of shared future and building a better world are the common aspirations of all peoples.
