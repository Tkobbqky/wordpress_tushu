I was a consultant for China International Culture Exchange Center （CICEC）; I was leading a team of visitors to Kazakhstan and Turkey. My purpose during the visit was to research how to promote cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between China and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative while building the Silk Road Economic Belt. During our interviews and discussions， we noted that most people， except for scholars in the related fields （such as orientalist scholars）， had little knowledge about or interest in the history value of cultural exchanges between China and the Central and Western Asian regions. What they were interested in was today's China. "Today's CFuna" refers to China since its reform and opening up in 1978， espeaally China under the leadership of Xi Jinping. Topics of interest included the differences between today's China and the China of Mao Zedong's era， especially what China's market economy is like， why China is developing so rapidly， whether China's polarization is as severe as Western media has reported， why corruption is breeding in China and whether Xi Jinping is capable of finding a solution.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　李君如，全国政协常委、中央党校原副校长，研究员、博士生导师。享受政府特殊津贴。长期从事马克思主义中国化思想史研究。任中国中共党史学会副会长、中国人民政协理论研究会副会长、中国人权理论研究会副会长、中共中央直属机关侨联主席。著有数百篇论文和几十部著作，其中由《毛泽东与近代中国》、《毛泽东与当代中国》、《毛泽东与毛泽东后的当代中国》组成的“毛泽东研究三部曲”获第11届中国图书奖。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
