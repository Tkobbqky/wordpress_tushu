The prevailing concept of literary landscape is convincing evidence that human space is socially oriented and it is not only the outcome of human beings' participation in spatial practice but a fairly important element for textual construction. It appears as place, scene, architecture and the like in literature to reveal our spatial practice. Therefore, a spatially directed examination about literary landscape may be productive thanks to the fact that a writer may display his or her literary space via different landscapes in certain period of writing which tells the writer's style and his or her cultural perspective on these landscapes.　　It is the American cultural geographer Carl O. Sauer who first interpreted literary works by focusing on geographical landscape. Into his The Morphology of Lan,dscape (1925) , Sauer introduced the concepts of geographical and cultural landscape. He focused his study on the close connection between geographical landscape and culture and revealed the cultural character of "geographical landscape" but neglected the relation between literature and geography (Mitchell 21).　　The relation mentioned above is discemed by lVhke Crang in his well-known Cultural Geography. Crang devotes the foruth chapter "Literary Landscapes: Writing and Geography" to the Concept of Literary Landscape:　　The text does not simply reflect an outside world. It is misleading to look at how "accurately" or otherwise it correspondsto the world. This sort of naive approach misses the most useful and interesting elements of literary landscapes. Literary landscapes are best thought of as a combination of literature and landscape, not with literature as a separate lens or mirror reflecting or distorting an outside world. Equally literature does more than simply provide an emotional counterpart, to an objective knowledge in geography. Rather literature offers ways of looking at the world that show a range oflandscapes of taste, experience and knowledge. To say it is subjective is to miss a key point. It is a social product-indeed in circulating ideas it is a social process of signification. It is a social medium. The ideologies and beliefs of peoples and epochs both shape and are shaped by these texts. They shape what authors feel able or driven to sayand how they say it.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书试图探讨詹姆斯小说在空间层面的文学内涵。近年来随着学界对空间转向的关注，空间批评和空间叙事成为文学研究的一大热点，国内外已有学者运用空间理论解读一些经典作家作品，因此本书对詹姆斯早期作品进行空间解读，试图有新的发现。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>傅淑琴，文学博士，南昌大学外国语学院副教授，主要研究方向为美国文学及西方文论。曾在***、省级核心期刊发表论文多篇。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
