Globally, the turmoil of international landscape is expected to continue in 2017, the prospect of world economy is still unclear, and the Brexit and the leadership transition in Germany, France and Italy have brought uncertainty to the future development of Europe. Against such backdrop, some people maintain to be cautious towards the "16+1 Cooperation", while it seems different to me. The word "crisis" (weiji) in Chinese consists of two parts, both "danger" (wei) and "opportunity" (ji), which indicates that opportunities often lie with danger. Looking forward to 2017, opportunities for the "16+1 Cooperation" lie ahead.　　First, good timing. The year 2017 marks a crucial year in China's development, as the Communist Party of China will convene the 19th National Congress, and the 13th Five Year Plan will be comprehensively and deeply implemented. Meanwhile, the economic and social development of CEECs will also enter the critical era. The economic growth rates of CEECs ranked top in Europe in recent years with strong domestic demand and improved investment environment. The region has also witnessed increasing national and regional cooperation initiatives. Under the new circumstances, China and CEECs share increasing common interests and demands, as well as stronger willingness to promote growth and development through cooperation.　　Second, favorable opportunities. The Chinese government has been making great efforts to promote the "Belt and Road" Initiative and will host the high-level forum on the "Belt and Road" Initiative in 2017, in a bid to implement more cooperative projects and inject strong impetus for building open economy and stimulating world economy. The CEECs are situated on the Eurasian continent along the "Belt and Road" Initiative, linking the developed EU market to the west and the energy market including Russia and Central Asia to the east. The unique location of the CEECs has brought huge potential to align development strategies with China and jointly build the "Belt and Road" Initiative.　　Third, popular support. On the China-EU level, China-EU relations have been developing smoothly. The 18th China-EU Leader's meeting was successfully held in Beijing in June, when both sides have reaffirmed to strengthen all-round cooperation, integrate development strategies, accelerate negotiations on China-EU investment agreement, and deepen coordination in intemational affairs including global governance. On the China-CEEC level, President Xi Jinping has visited the region twice in the first half of the year, elevating the bilateral relations. On the "16+1 Cooperation" level, 2016 marks the China-CEEC people-to-people exchange year and closer people-to-people exchanges. Many CEECs have introduced facilitation measures for people to travel, which has contributed to frequent personnel flow and laid the popular support for further cooperation.　　Facing these opportunities, we should promote the "16+1 Cooperation" in the next phase based on the "three alignments".　　First, to align the "16+1 Cooperation" with the "Belt and Road" Initiative. Since it was first put forward by President Xi Jinping, the "Belt and Road" Initiative has been warmly echoed by the international community. More than 100 countries and international organizations have participated in the "Belt and Road" Initiative, and China has signed the agreements on jointly building the "Belt and Road" Initiative with more than 30 countries along the route, as well as conducted cooperation on production capacity with more than 20 countries. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has been established. The Silk Road Fund has accelerated the implementation of specific projects, and a large number of projects have also been implemented smoothly.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　中国和中东欧国家智库研讨会暨人文交流年闭幕式论文集目录16+1智库网络在推动中国和中东欧国家相互理解上发挥重要作用。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
